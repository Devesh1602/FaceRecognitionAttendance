# Face Recognition-based Attendance System

Welcome to the "Face Recognition-based Attendance System" repository, my Project Based Learning(PBL) Project! This project offers a convenient and efficient solution for managing attendance using facial recognition technology. The system comprises two main files: setup.ipynb and train.ipynb.

## Project Overview

The project revolves around simplifying attendance management through facial recognition. By following a few straightforward steps, users can set up the system to take attendance automatically and accurately. The process involves capturing images, training the model, recognizing faces, and recording attendance details.
